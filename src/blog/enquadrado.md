### About it

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

"Enquadrado" is a long-form generative collection created using p5.js, a programming language for creative coding.

The word "enquadrado" is derived from Portuguese, and refers to the act of adjusting and placing something in a specific location. It is similar in sound and meaning to the English word "square."

The collection is a visual representation of various moments in life, with each square serving as a unique space for something. The squares are designed to be flexible and adaptable, much like the way our surroundings and circumstances change over time. Some spaces may need to be larger or smaller to accommodate different needs, and there is often overlap and sharing between them.

Overall, "Enquadrado" is a thoughtful and artistic exploration of the complexity and fluidity of life, and the ways in which we create order and meaning in the world around us.
