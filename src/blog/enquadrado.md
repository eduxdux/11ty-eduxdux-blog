### About it

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

"Enquadrado" is a long-form generative collection created using p5.js, a programming language for creative coding.

The word "enquadrado" is derived from Portuguese, and refers to the act of adjusting and placing something in a specific location. It is similar in sound and meaning to the English word "square."

The collection is a visual representation of various moments in life, with each square serving as a unique space for something. The squares are designed to be flexible and adaptable, much like the way our surroundings and circumstances change over time. Some spaces may need to be larger or smaller to accommodate different needs, and there is often overlap and sharing between them.

Overall, "Enquadrado" is a thoughtful and artistic exploration of the complexity and fluidity of life, and the ways in which we create order and meaning in the world around us.

### Inspirations

This work drew inspiration from a variety of sources beyond the field of generative art.

The primary inspiration came from the production of Brazilian tapestries, which often feature rectangles or squares made from colorful, non-linear lines. The result is a unique and cohesive composition.

Another source of inspiration was street art and the paintings created by people who use spray paint to decorate doors and gates without proper isolation. In Brazil, it is common to see paint residue in the form of dots or lines that are unintentionally left behind on nearby surfaces. While many consider this to be an eyesore, it also creates a distinctive and memorable "accidental" geometry

Overall, this work is a reflection of the artist's diverse range of influences, which come together to create a unique and thought-provoking composition
