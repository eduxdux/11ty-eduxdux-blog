## Why Learn Markdown

If you have worked on any GitHub repo, you would have surely seen a **README.md** file, this is the markdown file where you can describe your repo. Markdown is easy to learn. It is helpful in writing questions on forums like *StackOverflow*,\
useful in commenting on *Pull Request* in Github, etc. It is a quick way to generated formatted text.

VS Code had inbuilt support for Markdown with the preview mode for generated HTML.\

Below is the markdown code that will generate HTML markup.

```javascript
//Classe do grid
class Grid {
  constructor(px, py, tm, colore, tanto, luz) {
    this.px = px;
    this.py = py;
    this.tm = tm;
    this.colore = colore;
    this.prob = rnd_int(0, 100);
    this.tanto = tanto;
    this.luz = luz;
  }

  mostra() {
    let perc = win / 800;
    let spc = 0;
    let spup = 1;
    let l_x;
    let l_y;
    let tmt;
    
```
